You can take the following suggestive steps to build the model:

Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)

Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).

Derive new features.

Reduce the number of variables using PCA.

Train a variety of models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).

Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Note that is is more important to identify churners than the non-churners accurately - choose an appropriate evaluation metric which reflects this business goal.

Finally, choose a model based on some evaluation metric.
